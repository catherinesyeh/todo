## instructions
Open [webpage](https://catherinesyeh.github.io/todo/) to start exploring. The app comes preloaded with a few todo items as an example.

Try these features out!
1. Type a todo into the input box and press the "add" button to add it to the list
2. Check off a todo by pressing the checkbox on the left of each item
3. Remove a todo by pressing the X icon on the right of each item
4. Reorder todo items by using the up and down arrow icons on the right of each item

Enjoy! :)

## resources used
I used/adapted some code fragments from this [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp) tutorial. I pointed these out more specifically in my comments.
